# Bartosz Borawski - Portfolio

This project was created with usage of __create-react-app__.

## Contents

The website contains informations regarding mine training of React - and is one of exercises by itself.

I have used __react-router__ for managing different parts of the application. It allowed me to separate contents into several pieces.
Those pieces include: _home_, _about_, _projects_, _contact_. I have also moved navbar and footer to separate components.

During development of this website I was practicing usage of `display: flex`. This powerful feature allowed me to create elegant style of the website with unbeatable ease. Modern browsers also support `min/max-width/height` inside of CSS, which properly used easily moved my footer component to the bottom of the viewport.

For now, website supports only Polish language. I am planning to add support for more languages in the future.

Project tab consists of projects container and component for single project card. At the day of writing this file (17 July 2018) I was creating every single card inside projects container. In the future I am planning to move this data into JSON file and map through array of projects.
